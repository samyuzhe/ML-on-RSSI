# ML-on-RSSI
Applying ML models to optimize the accuracy of distance measurement based on measuring the RSSI value of BLE advertising between ESP32 boards 
The csv files are the data collected from diffirent environment by measuring the RSSI value collected by BLE advertising from two ESP32 boards.
ml1 is to test the proformence of the models on the datasets; ml is the final model comparison version.
